    "- **Neuron**: thing that holds a number\n",

    "        - activation values are ideally between 0 - 1 (converted as such using the **sigmoid function**!)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hidden Layers**: layers between the input & output layers\n",
    "    - the activations from one layer determine the activations of the next layer\n",
    "\n",
    "- **weights**: numbers assigned to each connection between each INDIVIDUAL neuron and EVERY neuron of the next layer\n",
    "    - e.g. **tweakable parameters to capture patterns between layers**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ex. weights of the first layer are numbers assigned to each connection between each INDIVIDUAL neuron of the first layer, and EVERY neuron of the second layer\n",
    "\n",
