# ML & Data Structures/Algorithms from Scratch

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of machine learning algorithms and data structures/algorithms from scratch. It also explores their relationships to the brain and nature overall.


- **Machine Learning**: Implementations of ML algorithms without external libraries (using only numpy)
- **Data Structures & Algorithms**: Fundamental data structures and algorithms, with additional practice questions
- **Biological Parallels**: Exploration of analogies to biological systems and nature


## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/DorsaRoh/ML-DSA.git`
2. Navigate to the desired directory
3. Run the scripts and explore implementations
